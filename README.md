Guihua: A Lua Gui and util liberary for nvim plugins

Note:
Most of the code in luakit folder extracted from https://github.com/iwiniwin/LuaKit
I like the design, but the code does not provide full test case

Some of the code was modified for vim lua
Most of the code in utils are not used ATM. Only tested memory_monitor.

note: luadevkit (https://github.com/luadevkit/core/) is a different tool

I will try to update any bug fix in upstream. Hopefuly LuaKit could be in luarocks
